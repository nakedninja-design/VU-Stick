Party VU Stick
--------------

The Party VU Stick is a vertical LED VU meter you can stick in the ground. It listens to the FM radio channel you have set (10 presets or custom) and lights up a rainbow of colors that follow the dynamics of the music that is playing. Very easy to build and assemble, and a 8-year old child can set it up.
